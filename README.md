This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This was a quick project for me to learn Next.js with. Used a YouTube course by NetNinja who is a great tutor. You can find the course here [NetNinja-NextJS-Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A63UxsQsEbU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g9gP2onazU5-2M-AzA8eBw&index=1)

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

I deployed the app using Vercel and here is the [Live Link](https://ninjalist-emmanueloloke.vercel.app/). Going to be building subsequent projects with NextJS henceforth. It offers great speed and flexibility.
